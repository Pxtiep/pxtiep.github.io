Atollo

Project: Riviera Lab (Luca Toniolo and Jacopo Pagin)

Materials:

Plexiglas, sand from Brenta and printed synthetic fabric.

Experiencing the nature we cannot renounce the artifice, we needs our own synthetic island.

On the other hand, nature has no need for man, the human sign must be ephemeral without renouncing its diversity.

Starting with the extermination of the essence itself of furniture we reached the concept of nomadic furniture.

Type: Industrial Design

Year: 2015
